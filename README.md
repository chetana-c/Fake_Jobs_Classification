# Analysis and classification of Job Postings as Fake / Legitimate

## Introduction
In this time of impending recession in the IT sector, the number of cases of fraudulent job posting is increasing. According to the Federal Trade Commission, Americans were scammed out of $68 million in the first quarter of 2022 due to fraudulent business and job opportunities. Employment-related scams have been a persistent problem, but they increased in 2020 as criminals preyed on people who had lost their jobs due to Covid. Employment scams have only become more sophisticated, so it’s critical to be cautious as a job seeker. To address this issue, our project aims to leverage the power of Machine Learning models to predict the genuineness of Job postings based on history data.

Our project’s goal is to be able to classify job postings as legitimate or not based on the data attributes used to train the model. Because we have the output label for the data points, this falls under the Supervised Machine Learning use case, and for our project, we are using classification models such as Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbours, Bayes Classifier, etc. In addition, we hope to discover valuable patterns in the data by using various visualization techniques to gain a better understanding of the data.
